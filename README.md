# command-line-rpg
command-line-rpg is a role-playing game that, instead of relying on a graphical interface, is interacted with exclusively by a command-line type input.

## Description
In the story, the main character, due to an accident involving a science experiment, gets transported to another world and must find his way back to his own world. By interacting with the command-line interface, move the character around the map, talk to NPC's, fight enemies, add items and equipment to your inventory, earn money, and progress through the story towards the end of the game.

## Visuals
To be added further into development.

## Contributing
At the moment, this project is closed to contributions. However, it will be opened for contributions later in development.

## Project Status
This project is currently in design, so most of the commits will be used to create character designs and dialog as well as map designs. Once most of the game design has been finallized, more of the commits will be focused on the scripts and implementation.
