Descriptions of in-game areas the player can visit will be included here.

Ghost town:
The first town that MC finds themselves in. With seemingly no inhabitants and a very
run-down appearance, this town is the epitome of a ghost town.
Building: run-down science facility
This is the building MC first finds himself in. A single-room building with a single
and no chair, the building feels a little cramped. Clear signs of a struggle: papers
strewn across the room, desk is damaged, door is broken, scratch marks on the walls,
seemingly blood stains on the walls.
Outside:
In the main area of the town, there are roughly a dozen buildings, all in roughly the
same shape as the science facility. Due to the giant rat that startles MC, he has no
time to explore the area further.

Road to X village:
After the giant rat encounter, MC flees down this path. There is an occasional tree or
shrub, but the landscape is mostly barren with withered grass. It isn't as hot as a
desert, but it is warmer than MC is used to. The road occasionally curves around a
large rock or tree, but it stays straight for the most part. This area is purely for
story purposes; the player cannot interact with anything in this area.
