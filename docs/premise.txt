On your first day at a new job at a groundbreaking science facility, you accidentally
enter an off-limits zone at the same time that a coworker starts an experiment. As a
result, you get sucked into a mirror in the room. Luckily, there is a machine
specifically built for these situations that can reverse the process that trapped you
in the mirror. However, when your coworker activiates the machine, he accidentally
trips and slams against the mirror, shattering it at the same time that you exit it.
Somehow, this ends up sending you to another dimension, one with a much less advanced
civilization with magic and monsters. Upon reaching the new world, your immediate goal
is to get back home, but you quickly discover that you are the only individual in this
world that cannot use magic. You must use your wits and knowledge of technology from
your home world to try to find a way to escape this dimension and return to your own.
